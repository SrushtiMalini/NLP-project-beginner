### Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning classifiers.

The goal is to identify and classify news articles as Fake News or Factual News with high accuracy.

#### Project Highlights
* Text Preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization, regex cleaning)
* POS Tagging and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for text analysis
* Sentiment Analysis using VADER
* Topic Modeling using LDA and LSI
* Machine Learning Classification with:

1. Logistic Regression (90% accuracy)

2. Naive Bayes (91.6% accuracy)

3. SVM (SGD Classifier - 91.6% accuracy)

#### Key Visualizations
* POS & NER Tag Plots
* Sentiment Distribution Bar Plot
* Topic Coherence Score Plot
* Final Model Accuracy Comparison Plot

All plots are available inside the notebook
